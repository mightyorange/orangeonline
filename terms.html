    <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
      <p>
        By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to
        you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before
        using the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part
        of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt
        to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to
        translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. 
       </p>
      <p>
        The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and
        other intellectual property rights related to it, belong to Orange(Jian Ren) Wen. 
        We are committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and
        efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make
        changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for
        any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without
        making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for. 
       </p>
      <p>
        The Orange Note app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to
        us, in order to provide service. It’s your responsibility to keep
        your device and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you
        do not jailbreak or root your device, which is the process of removing
        software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating
        system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
        malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security
        features and it could mean that the Orange Note app won’t work properly
        or at all. 
       </p>
      <p>
        You should be aware that there are certain things that we will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app
        will require the app to have an active internet connection. The
        connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider,
        but we cannot take responsibility for the app not working at
        full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have
        any of your data allowance left. If you’re using the app outside of an
        area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement
        with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
        be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration
        of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges.
       </p>
      <p>
        In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges,
        including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home
        territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
        you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app,
        please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from
        the bill payer for using the app. Along the same lines, we
        cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You
        need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
        battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, we
        cannot accept responsibility. 
       </p>
      <p>
        When you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although 
        we endeavor to ensure that it is updated
        and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide
        service to us so that we can make it available to you. We accepts no
        liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result
        of relying wholly on this functionality of the app. At some point, we
        may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on – the
        requirements for system (and for any additional systems we decide to
        extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to
        download the updates if you want to keep using the app. We do not
        promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
        and/or works with the version that you have installed on your device.
        However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when
        offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may
        terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to
